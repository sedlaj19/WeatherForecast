# WeatherForecast
App showing weather forecast for ten hardcoded cities (PRague, London, Vienna, Paris, Wellington, New York, Berlin, Zlin, Barcelona, Tokyo). Purpose of this app is to show how I create the apps. Which patterns do I use, the structure of the app, architecture, etc.

The app is written in Kotlin with a couple of third party libraries (Retrofit, Coroutines, Dagger, Android Architecture Components). It implements MVVM architecture/pattern.

I am pretty sure, that the app could be improved in some ways. It could have more sophisticated error handling, it could have better UI with some transitions and animations, few images would make it probably better too. On the other hand, the app has been created in a few days from scratch. I have focused on the code and architecture/structure more than on the app icon and so on, so forgive me please that these parts are missing. I suppose that you know how easy it is to change these things.

Thank you!
